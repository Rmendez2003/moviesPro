# moviesPro
This was one of my projects for my introduction to python class. It requires the .csv file attached, or any other .csv file that is split up the same way as the one attached. Once the program is ran, it will ask the user to input the name of the .csv file with all of the movie data that they would like to include. After the programs reads the file in and sorts it, the user will be able to choose by what criteria they would like to search for movies, that could be by title, director name, highest grossing film made in a specific year, and all made in a user-inputted year range. The user could also choose to sort the list of films by revenue and write the resuts to a new file.
